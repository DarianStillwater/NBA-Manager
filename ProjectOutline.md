```

*Big moments* (broadcast style, dramatic):
```
"Green sets the screen at the top of the key. Curry comes off it,
Davis switches onto him. Curry with the step-back three... BANG!
That's his fifth triple of the quarter!"
```

**Base Mechanics**:
- Random chance each possession (very low %, ~0.01%)
- Higher on contact plays (drives, rebounds, screens)
- Lower on jump shots and free throws

**Risk Modifiers**:
- **Fatigue**: Risk scales up as energy drops (2x risk at 50% energy, 4x at 25%)
- **Durability attribute**: High durability players have lower base risk
- **Injury history**: Previously injured body parts have elevated re-injury risk

#### Injury Types & History Tracking

**Body Part Categories**:
| Body Part | Min Recovery | Max Recovery | Re-injury Risk |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Ankle | 3 days | 3 weeks | +25% to ankle |
| Knee (minor) | 1 week | 4 weeks | +30% to knee |
| Knee (ACL/major) | Season | Season+ | +50% to knee |
| Back | 1 week | 6 weeks | +20% to back |
| Shoulder | 2 weeks | 8 weeks | +25% to shoulder |
| Concussion | 1 week | 4 weeks | Protocol required |
| Hamstring | 1 week | 4 weeks | +35% to hamstring |

**Historic Injury Tracking**:
- Each player has injury history record
- Past injuries create "weak spots" with elevated risk
- Play-by-play can reference: "Re-aggravated his surgically repaired knee"
- Chronic injury players may need load management all season

#### Load Management System

**Fatigue Meter**:
- Visible per-player fatigue level (0-100)
- Displayed in roster panel and lineup screens
- Drains with minutes played, recovers with rest

**Minutes Recommendations**:
- System suggests: "Thompson should play <28 min tonight"
- Based on current fatigue, recent workload, injury history
- Ignoring recommendations increases risk

**Rest Days Matter**:
- Back-to-backs: High fatigue risk, no recovery time
- 1 day rest: Partial fatigue recovery
- 2+ days rest: Full fatigue recovery
- Schedule impacts lineup decisions

**DNP-Rest Option**:
- Can mark healthy player as DNP-Rest
- Player fully recovers fatigue
- May impact morale (stars don't like sitting)
- Media/fans may react negatively to resting stars

#### Injury Report System

**Status Determination**:
- Based on days remaining + uncertainty factor
- **Out**: 5+ days remaining (100% miss)
- **Doubtful**: 3-4 days remaining (25% chance to play)
- **Questionable**: 1-2 days remaining (50-75% chance)
- **Probable**: 0 days, minor lingering (90% chance)

**Uncertainty Mechanic**:
- Questionable players: "60% to play" - unknown until game time
- User doesn't know for sure until pregame
- Can choose to risk borderline players or hold out

**Game Day Decision**:
- For Questionable/Probable players, you decide:
  - Play them (risk aggravation)
  - Hold out (guarantee rest)
- Playing injured players has performance penalty + re-injury risk

- One unhappy player drags down team chemistry
- Spreads negativity to others
- Can create team-wide morale drop

**Media Leaks**:
- Player makes comments to media
- "Sources say [Player] is unhappy with role"
- Creates external pressure
- Affects your job security with owner

#### Team Chemistry System

**Chemistry Level**: 0-100 (calculated, not directly set)

**Chemistry Factors**:
- Personality compatibility matrix
- Time played together (tenure bonus)
- Veteran leadership presence
- Recent conflicts vs bonding moments
- Win/loss streaks

#### Chemistry Gameplay Impact

**Passing & Ball Movement**:
- High chemistry: Better passing accuracy, fewer turnovers
- Low chemistry: Selfish play, more turnovers, iso-heavy offense

**Help Defense & Rotations**:
- High chemistry: Players help each other, good rotations
- Low chemistry: Breakdowns, blown coverages, miscommunication

**Clutch Performance**:
- High chemistry: Trust each other in big moments
- Low chemistry: Finger-pointing, tight in close games

**Playbook Execution**:
- High chemistry: Plays run smoothly, good timing
- Low chemistry: Freelancing, ignoring plays called

#### Personality Conflicts

**Baseline Tension** (automatic):
- Two high-ego players = constant friction
- Ball-dominant players compete for touches
- Veterans may resent young stars

**Event Triggers** (specific incidents):
- Shot selection disputes ("He never passes!")
- Blame for losses ("He cost us the game")
- Playing time complaints going public
- Contract jealousy

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Trade one player
- Reduce one player's role
- Let time heal (slow, risky)
- Some conflicts never resolve

#### Positive Chemistry Builders

**Veteran Leadership**:
- High-leadership vets boost team chemistry
- Mentor young players
- Calm locker room after losses

**Winning**:
- Win streaks build chemistry naturally
- Playoff success bonds teams

**Time Together**:
- Players who've been teammates 2+ years have bonus chemistry

### 7. JOB SECURITY ✅ COMPLETE

#### Job Security Meter
- 0-100 scale (visible to user)
- Below 50: Concerning, owner watching closely
- Below 25: "Hot seat" - active danger
- Below 10: Firing imminent

#### Setting Expectations (Season Start)

**Negotiable Goals**:
- Owner proposes expectations based on roster
- You can push back: "This roster is rebuilding"
- Agree on realistic targets together
- Targets become your benchmark

**Expectation Types**:
- Win total (e.g., "45+ wins")
- Playoff appearance
- Playoff round advancement
- Player development goals
- Chemistry/culture goals

#### What Hurts Job Security

**Missing Expectations**:
- Expected playoffs but missed
- Expected 50 wins, got 40
- Bigger gap = bigger drop in security

**Playoff Underperformance**:
- First round exit as top seed
- Losing to inferior opponent
- Blown 3-1 lead devastating

**Player Issues**:
- Star player demanding trade
- Morale issues going public
- Locker room problems in media

**Development Failures**:
- Young players not improving
- Top draft pick busting
- Wasted potential

#### Low Job Security Consequences

**Owner Meetings**:
- Summoned to owner's office
- Given ultimatums: "Win 5 of next 10 games"
- Clear, measurable survival requirements

**Front Office Interference**:
- Owner blocks certain trades
- Mandates playing time for favorites
- Forces you to start/bench specific players
- Overrules your decisions

**Firing**:
- **Mid-season**: Can be fired during season if security hits 0
- **End-of-season**: Survive season but fired in offseason
- Get a final meeting explaining why

#### After Being Fired

**Job Search**:
- Your career continues (unless you choose to retire)
- See list of open coaching jobs
- Apply for positions you want
- Interview process (simplified)
- Get hired based on your resume/reputation

**Reputation Matters**:
- Past success helps land new jobs
- Championships make you attractive
- Repeated firings hurt future prospects
- Can rebuild career with smaller program

#### Being Recruited

**Other Teams Notice Success**:
- Winning attracts attention
- Better jobs may reach out
- Can receive unsolicited offers
- Higher salary, better roster opportunities

**Loyalty Decisions**:
- Stay with team you built?
- Take the better opportunity?
- Breaking contract has consequences

### 8. MEDIA SYSTEM ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### Post-Game Press Conferences

**Frequency**: After notable games only (~30% of games)
- Big wins (blowouts, upsets, playoff clinching)
- Tough losses (blown leads, bad performances)
- Controversies (ejections, conflicts, injuries)
- Milestones (records, streaks, achievements)
- Playoff games (always)

#### Question Types

**Game Performance**:
- "Why did you go small in the 4th quarter?"
- "What happened on defense tonight?"
- "Walk us through that final possession."

**Player-Specific**:
- "Is [Player] in a slump?"
- "Why isn't [Player] getting more minutes?"
- "How do you evaluate [Rookie]'s development?"

**Controversy/Drama**:
- "Reports say [Player] is unhappy. Comment?"
- "There seemed to be tension on the bench. What happened?"
- "How do you respond to critics saying you've lost the locker room?"

**Forward-Looking**:
- "Can this team make the playoffs?"
- "What needs to change going forward?"
- "Is [Injured Player] close to returning?"

#### Response System

**Multiple Choice Tones**:
- 🔥 **Aggressive**: Call out players, challenge critics, show emotion
- 🤝 **Diplomatic**: Balanced, professional, non-committal
- 💯 **Honest**: Direct truth, even if uncomfortable
- 🚫 **Deflect**: Dodge the question, redirect to something else

Each question shows 3-4 response options with tone indicators.

#### Response Consequences

**Player Morale Impact**:
- Criticizing a player in press → Their morale drops
- Praising/supporting a player → Their morale rises
- "I need more from [Player]" vs "He's working hard"

**Team Chemistry Impact**:
- Taking blame yourself → Team appreciates it
- Blaming players → Locker room tension
- "I put them in a bad position" vs "They didn't execute"

**Owner/Job Security Impact**:
- Professional responses maintain owner confidence
- Controversial statements can concern ownership
- "We're going in the right direction" vs "This organization needs changes"

**No Media Relationship Tracking** (simplified):
- Each press conference is standalone
- No ongoing media reputation system

### 9. AI ADAPTATION ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

#### What AI Tracks

**Strategic Preferences** (primary focus):
- Pace preference (fast vs slow)
- Offensive style (3-point heavy, post-up, balanced)
- Defensive scheme tendencies (man vs zone usage)
- Aggressiveness (pressing, fouling, gambling)

**Not Tracked** (simplified):
- Individual play calls
- Specific lineup combinations
- Timeout timing

#### Adaptation Speed

**Within-Game Adaptation** (immediate):
- AI adjusts mid-game as patterns emerge
- If you spam 3-pointers, AI tightens perimeter D by halftime
- If you go small, AI exploits it quickly
- Real-time chess match with AI coach

#### How Adaptation Affects Gameplay

**Counters Your Style**:
- Heavy 3-point team? AI packs the perimeter
- Love fast pace? AI slows it down
- Zone defense? AI finds weaknesses in your scheme

**Exploits Weaknesses**:
- AI identifies what you're bad at defending
- Attacks your slow rotations, weak rebounding, etc.
- Targets your worst defenders

**Predictability Penalty**:
- Being one-dimensional has diminishing returns
- Same play/strategy repeated loses effectiveness
- AI "figures you out" faster if predictable

#### Counter-Play (Variety Rewarded)

**Mix Up Your Approach**:
- Varying pace keeps AI guessing
- Switching defensive schemes mid-game confuses AI
- Strategic diversity is rewarded

**The Meta-Game**:
- If you're always fast-paced, slow down sometimes
- If you're known for 3s, attack the rim unexpectedly
- Keeps opponents from fully adapting

### 10. FINANCIAL SYSTEM 🔶 PARTIAL

#### Salary Cap (Full CBA Rules)

**Cap Structure**:
- Soft cap: Can exceed with exceptions
- Luxury tax threshold: Penalties above this line

## TECHNICAL PATTERNS

### Manager Pattern
```csharp
public class NewManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static NewManager Instance { get; private set; }

    void Awake()
    {
        if (Instance == null) {
            Instance = this;
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        } else Destroy(gameObject);
    }
}
```

### Event-Driven Communication
```csharp
// Managers fire events
public event Action<InjuryEvent> OnPlayerInjured;

// UI subscribes
InjuryManager.Instance.OnPlayerInjured += HandleInjury;
```

### Save/Load Pattern
```csharp
public ManagerState CreateSaveState() { ... }
public void RestoreFromSave(ManagerState state) { ... }
```

## PLAYER DATA & CAREER STATS SYSTEM

### Data Architecture

**Separation of Concerns:**
- **Base Data** (`players.json`): Biographical info + attributes only, never modified during gameplay
- **Runtime State** (Player objects): Modified during gameplay (energy, morale, injuries, stats)
- **Save State** (PlayerSaveState): Captures runtime changes + full career history

### Game Log System

**GameLog Class** (`Core/Data/GameLog.cs`):
- Individual game performance records
- Tracks: date, opponent, home/away, all box score stats, game result
- Only kept for **current season** - wiped at season end to keep saves small

**Retention Policy:**
- Current season: Full game logs available
- Past seasons: Only `SeasonStats` totals/averages persist
- Career: `List<SeasonStats>` with one entry per season played

### Career Stats Persistence

**What gets saved:**
- Full `List<SeasonStats>` for career history
- Current season includes `List<GameLog>` (cleared at season end)
- All totals and computed averages per season

**Save/Load Flow:**
- On Save: `PlayerSaveState.CreateFrom(player)` captures full career
- On Load: Apply `PlayerSaveState` including career history to base players
- On New Game: Fresh from `players.json` + mods, no career history

### Generated Players (Rookies)

**Integration:**
- Generated rookies become regular `Player` objects in same database
- `PlayerDatabase.RegisterGeneratedPlayer()` handles ID collision prevention
- Career stats start fresh from draft year
- Survive save/load cycles identically to base roster players
